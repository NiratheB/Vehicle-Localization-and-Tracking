I want to thank Jagat Rath to help me from ground up for this project. His support and motivation have given me the confidence to work on this topic. Regardless of my countless silly questions, he was always patient and calm in discussions. I am grateful for his time and availability to me.

I am very lucky to have Professor Matthias Althoff for his guidance and advice. I want to express my gratitude for his time and feedback, in spite of his tremendously busy schedule.

My heartfelt gratitude goes to my husband, who calmed me when I panicked, my parents who constantly encouraged me and believed in me, my sister for sharing laughter and my in-laws for supporting and standing by me. I feel blessed to have such a wonderful company around me and I thank God with all of my heart for the strength and opportunity to study here in TUM.
