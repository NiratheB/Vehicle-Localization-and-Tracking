With the current pace of development in autonomous vehicles, the demand for high-intelligent collision avoidance system is increasing. Due to unavailability of measurements from Lidar, GPS and radar sensors, researchers have utilized state estimation methods to converge measurements to the true state of the system. The purpose of this thesis is to review and implement different algorithms of set-based state estimation using zonotopes as domain representation on existing dataset of real traffic participants. Set-based methods are used to bound the true state of the system to a set, in contrast to stochastic methods which gives an estimation close to the true state. Encapsulating the true state in a set is important for the use-case in autonomous vehicles to forbid tolerance in divergence from the true state. The algorithms are compared in terms of computation time, time to converge, tightness of bound and accuracy. H-$\infty$ interval observer has perfomed better in terms of computation time but starts with a wider initial bound. Segment intersection minimization using P-Radius is faster than using F-Radius, but compromises on the bounds and accuracy. Of all the methods compared, the segment minimization using F-Radius gives the most accurate estimates.
