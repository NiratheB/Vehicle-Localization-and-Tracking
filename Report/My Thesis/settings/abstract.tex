With the current pace of development in autonomous vehicles, the demand for high-intelligent collision avoidance system is increasing. Due to noise in measurements from Lidar, GPS and radar sensors, researchers have utilized state estimation methods to converge measurements to the true state of the system. The purpose of this thesis is to review and implement different algorithms of state estimation using zonotopes as domain representation on existing dataset of real traffic participants. The algorithms are compared in terms of error, time to converge and tightness of bound.
