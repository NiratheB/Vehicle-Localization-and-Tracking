With the current pace of development in autonomous vehicles, the demand for high-intelligent collision avoidance system is increasing. Due to noise in measurements from Lidar, GPS and radar sensors, researchers have utilized state estimation methods to converge measurements to the true state of the system. The purpose of this thesis is to review and implement different algorithms of set-based state estimation using zonotopes as domain representation on existing dataset of real traffic participants. Set-based methods are used in order to bound the true state of the system to a set, in contrast to an estimation from stochastic methods tolerating slight divergence from the true state, which is undesirable in autonomous vehicles to ensure safety. The algorithms are compared in terms of computation time, time to converge, tightness of bound and accuracy.
