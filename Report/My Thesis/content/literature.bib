@article{Zorzi2017,
abstract = {We consider a family of divergence-based minimax approaches to perform robust filtering. The mismodeling budget, or tolerance, is specified at each time increment of the model. More precisely, all possible model increments belong to a ball which is formed by placing a bound on the Tau-divergence family between the actual and the nominal model increment. Then, the robust filter is obtained by minimizing the mean square error according to the least favorable model in that ball. It turns out that the solution is a family of Kalman like filters. Their gain matrix is updated according to a risk sensitive like iteration where the risk sensitivity parameter is now time varying. As a consequence, we also extend the risk sensitive filter to a family of risk sensitive like filters according to the Tau-divergence family.},

@article{Kuhn1998,
abstract = {A new method for rigorously computing orbits of discrete dynamical systems is introduced. High order zonotope enclosures of the orbit are computed, using only matrix algebra. The wrapping effect can be made arbitrarily small by choosing the order high enough. The method is easy to implement and especially suited for parallel computing. It is compared to other well known strategies, and several examples are given.},
