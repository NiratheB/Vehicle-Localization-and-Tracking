@article{Zorzi2017,
abstract = {We consider a family of divergence-based minimax approaches to perform robust filtering. The mismodeling budget, or tolerance, is specified at each time increment of the model. More precisely, all possible model increments belong to a ball which is formed by placing a bound on the Tau-divergence family between the actual and the nominal model increment. Then, the robust filter is obtained by minimizing the mean square error according to the least favorable model in that ball. It turns out that the solution is a family of Kalman like filters. Their gain matrix is updated according to a risk sensitive like iteration where the risk sensitivity parameter is now time varying. As a consequence, we also extend the risk sensitive filter to a family of risk sensitive like filters according to the Tau-divergence family.},

abstract = {A new method for rigorously computing orbits of discrete dynamical systems is introduced. High order zonotope enclosures of the orbit are computed, using only matrix algebra. The wrapping effect can be made arbitrarily small by choosing the order high enough. The method is easy to implement and especially suited for parallel computing. It is compared to other well known strategies, and several examples are given.},

abstract = {Autonomous driving functions for motorized road vehicles represent an important area of research today. In this context, sensor and object recognition technologies for self-driving cars have to fulfill enhanced requirements in terms of accuracy, unambiguousness, robustness, space demand and of course costs. The paper introduces different levels of automated driving functions according to the SAE standard and derives requirements on sensor technologies. Subsequently, state of the art technologies for object detection and identification as well as systems under development are introduced, discussed and evaluated in view of their suitability for automotive applications.},

For that, motion models are applied in order to increase the accuracy and robustness of the estimation. This paper surveys numerous (especially curvilinear) models and compares their performance using a tracking tasks which includes the fusion of GPS and odometry data with an Unscented Kalman Filter. For evaluation purposes, a highly accurate reference trajectory has been recorded using an RTK-supported DGPS receiver. With this ground truth data, the performance of the models is evaluated in different scenarios and driving situations.},

@article{Singer1970,
abstract = {The majority of tactical weapons systems require that manned maneuverable vehicles, such as aircraft, ships, and submarines, be tracked accurately. An optimal Kalman filter has been derived for this purpose using a target model that is simple to implement and that represents closely the motions of maneuvering targets. Using this filter, parametric tracking accuracy data have been generated as a function of target maneuver characteristics, sensor observation noise, and data rate and that permits rapid a priori estimates of tracking performance to be made when maneuvering targets are to be tracked by sensors providing any combination of range, bearing, and elevation measurements. {\textcopyright} 1970, IEEE.
