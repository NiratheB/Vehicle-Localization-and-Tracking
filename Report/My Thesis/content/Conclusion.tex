\chapter{Conclusion} \label{ch:conclusion}
A demand for intelligent collision avoidance system is timeless. To take load off sensors and hardware of a vehicle, state estimation algorithms can be used to track vehicle and estimate properties required for collision-free path prediction. On comparing multiple techniques using different models to represent the tracked vehicle, it can be concluded that the segment minimization using F-Radius is the most accurate. However, in terms of computation time, the H-$\infty$ overrules other methods. Further developments can include implementing the technique in real vehicle system and use the estimation to track vehicles.
