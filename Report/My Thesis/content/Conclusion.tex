\chapter{Conclusion} \label{ch:conclusion}
A demand for intelligent collision avoidance system is timeless. State estimation algorithms can be used to track vehicles with assurance to predict a collision-free path. One significant factor is to fit the behavior of traffic participants to a mathematical model. Besides, a high number of measured states give sharper enclosure. In comparison to segment intersection techniques, the H-$\infty$-based interval observer does not worsen much with model complexity. This makes the interval observer attractive to be used for complex models. In addition, H-$\infty$-based observer is the fastest estimator, and the estimated bounds can be tuned using parameters. In conclusion, the H-$\infty$-based interval observer along with the point-mass model is the best choice for a collision avoidance system. This paper can be a starting point to implement higher-defined models of the tracked vehicle and compare the performance of state estimation methods. The state estimation methods can further be evaluated by the effect of the initial estimated state on the algorithms. Further developments can be to use non-linear state-estimation algorithms on complex vehicle models and compare the performance.
