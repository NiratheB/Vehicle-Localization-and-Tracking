\chapter{Conclusion} \label{ch:conclusion}
A demand for intelligent collision avoidance system is timeless. State estimation algorithms can be used to track vehicle with assurance to predict a collision-free path. One significant factor is to fit the behavior of traffic participants to a mathematical model. Besides, higher number of measured state gives sharper encosure. In comparison to segment intersection techniques, the H-$\infty$-based interval oberver does not worsen with model complexity. This makes H-$\infty$ attractive to be used for complex models. In addition, H-$\infty$-based observer is the fastest estimator, and the estimate bounds can be tuned using parameters. In conclusion, the H-$\infty$-based interval observer along with point-mass model is the best choice for collision avoidance system. This paper can be a starting point to implement higher-defined models of the tracked vehicle and compare the performance of state estimation methods. The state estimation methods can further be evaluated on the effect of the initial estimated state on the algorithms. Further developments can be to use non-linear state-estimation algorithms on complex vehicle models and compare the performance.
