\chapter{Vehicle Localization : The Guaranteed Estimation Problem} \label{ch:problem}
\section{Problem Formulation}
Let us denote the state of the vehicle to be tracked at time $k$ as $x_k$ and the measured state as $y_k$. The equations to predict $x_k$ from a previous step $x_{k-1}$ and the mapping from measurement, $y_k$ to state, $x_k$ is shown in equation \eqref{formula:system}, where $A$,$E$,$C$ and $F$ are known matrices, $w_k$ and $v_k$ are process noise and measurement noise at time $k$, respectively. 
\begin{equation}
\label{formula:system}
\begin{split}
x_{k+1} &= Ax_k + Ew_k\\
y_k &= Cx_k + Fv_k
\end{split}
\end{equation}

The state of the tracked vehicle can be represented using position, velocity, and acceleration in x and y-direction. Different states can be estimated using different models, whereas the measured state of the vehicle is assumed to be position in x and y-direction for all models.
\begin{equation*}
y =[ 
\begin{matrix}
s_x & s_y
\end{matrix}
]^T
\end{equation*}

Given a model (\eqref{formula:system}), the problem of set-based state estimation is to compute an outer bound of the state($x_k$) consisting of the possible values of the true possible state of the system. The dimensions of the state($x_k$), the state transition matrix($A$) and measurement matrix ($C$) differ across different models as discussed in the next section.
\section{Vehicle Model}
Three linear systems are implemented to compare the different algorithms for tracked vehicles. Although there exists highly precise vehicle models for ego vehicles, the simplest models are used here to represent the tracked vehicle as complex vehicle models require parameters which are non-acquirable for tracked vehicles. In particular, physical dimensions like wheelbase or side-slip, cannot be measured directly. Another reason is that adding steering angle and yaw rate makes the system non-linear and hence does not suit all the algorithms presented. Hence, the following models are investigated:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Constant Velocity Model}
\item \textbf{Constant Acceleration Model}
\item \textbf{Point Mass Model}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Constant Velocity Model}
The vehicle is assumed to travel in constant velocity \cite{Schubert2008}. The state of the system ($x_k$), state transition matrix ($A$), and the measurement matrix($C$) is shown in \eqref{formula:cvmodel}.
\begin{equation}
\label{formula:cvmodel}
\begin{split}
x &=
\left[\begin{matrix}
s_x & s_y & v_x & v_y
\end{matrix}\right]^{T}\\
A&= \left[\begin{matrix}
1 & 0 & \Delta T & 0\\
0 & 1 & 0 & \Delta T\\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1\\
\end{matrix}\right]\\
C&= \left[\begin{matrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0
\end{matrix}\right]
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Constant Acceleration Model}
Although the constant velocity model is easy to implement, it is unrealistic to assume constant velocity. Acceleration model takes care of changing velocity and assumes constant acceleration \cite{Schubert2008}.Hence, the estimation error for position and velocity are relatively smaller when the velocity is constantly changing. The state of the system ($x_k$), state transition matrix ($A$), and the measurement matrix($C$) is shown in \eqref{formula:camodel}.

\begin{equation}
\label{formula:camodel}
\begin{split}
x&= \left[\begin{matrix}
s_x & s_y & v_x & v_y & a_x & a_y
\end{matrix}\right]^{T}\\
A&= \left[\begin{matrix}
1 & 0 & \Delta T & 0 & \frac{1}{2}\Delta T^2 & 0\\
0 & 1 & 0 & \Delta T & 0 & \frac{1}{2}\Delta T^2 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & \Delta T & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & \Delta T\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{matrix}\right] \\
C&= \left[\begin{matrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0
\end{matrix}\right]
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Point-Mass Model}
It is trivial to note that vehicles might have varying acceleration which is not satisfied in the previous models, which brings us to the point-mass model \cite{Althoff}, which is similar to the constant acceleration model, except that the acceleration can strike up to a certain limit. This model treats the tracked vehicle as a point mass, ignoring wheel-base, slip-angle, etc. of the tracked vehicle. The state transition and measurement matrices are the same as the constant acceleration model. The acceleration bounds are set as $11.5 m/s^2$ in both x and y-direction for this paper.

\section{Domain Representation}
The computation time of the algorithms largely varies due to the choice of shape to represent the set of state of the system. Zonotopes are gaining fame in the set-based state estimation techniques \cite{Le2013}, due to its control of wrapping effect and that the Minkowski sum of the zonotope results in zonotopes. The prediction step for the state estimation method can be simplified to basic matrix computation. The functionalities required in the correction step are implemented in the Matlab\textsuperscript{\tiny\textregistered} toolbox CORA (COntinuous Reachability Analyzer) \cite{Althoff2018}.

Zonotopes are represented by a center, denoted by $p$ and generators, denoted by $H$. An m-zonotope in $\mathbb{R}^n$ can be defined as an affine transformation by $H$ of an m-dimensional hypercube in $\mathbb{R}^n$ centered at $p$. Minkowski sum, zonotope reduction, and the convex hull of zonotopes are required to be computed in the state estimation algorithms. The toolbox, CORA, is used to construct zonotopes and apply the computation for zonotopes in the algorithms.
