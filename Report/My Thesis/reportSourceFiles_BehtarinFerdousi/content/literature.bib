abstract = {This paper reviews the use of set-membership methods in fault diagnosis (FD) and fault tolerant control (FTC). Setmembership methods use a deterministic unknown-but-bounded description of noise and parametric uncertainty (interval models). These methods aims at checking the consistency between observed and predicted behaviour by using simple sets to approximate the exact set of possible behaviour (in the parameter or the state space). When an inconsistency is detected between the measured and predicted behaviours obtained using a faultless system model, a fault can be indicated. Otherwise, nothing can be stated. The same principle can be used to identify interval models for fault detection and to develop methods for fault tolerance evaluation. Finally, some real applications will be used to illustrate the usefulness and performance of set-membership methods for FD and FTC.},

abstract={In this paper, a new approach to worst-case simulation of discrete linear time- invariant interval dynamic systems is proposed. For stable systems, the new approach solves the problem of worst-case simulation by determining the interval hull enclosing the system states region at every iteration through optimisation. The originality of this approach is that it maintains time-invariant parametric uncertainties during the simulation process. Several previous algorithms have considered the case of parametric time-varying uncertainties (El Ghauoi, L., Calafiore, G.: Worst-Case Simulation of Uncertain Systems, in: Garulli, A., Tesi, A., and Vicino, A. (eds), Robustness in Identification and Control, Springer, London, 1999). However, Cuguer' o (Avoiding Possible Instability in Robust Simulation of Stable Parametric Uncertain Time-Invariant Systems, in: Proceedings of 40th Conference on Decision and Control, Florida, 2001) has presented possible instability problems when simulating a time-invariant uncertain system as if it were time-varying, this result being the motivation for the approach proposed in this paper. The optimisation problem associated with the approach proposed must be solved globally in order to guarantee that the minimum volume box enclosing the region of system states has been derived. In this paper, a global optimisation algorithm based on an interval branch and bound strategy is proposed. Finally, two real application examples are used to test the performance of the approach proposed.},

@article{Combastel2015,
abstract = {State bounding observation based on zonotopes is the subject of this paper. Dealing with zonotopes is motivated by set operations resulting in simple matrix calculations with regard to the often huge number of facets and vertices of the equivalent polytopes. Discrete-time LTV/LPV systems with state and measurement uncertainties are considered. Based on a new zonotope size criterion called {\textless}sup{\textgreater}FW{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}-radius, and by merging optimal and robust observer gain designs, a Zonotopic Kalman Filter (ZKF) is proposed with a proof of robust convergence. The notion of covariation is introduced and results in an explicit bridge between the zonotopic set-membership and the stochastic paradigms for Kalman Filtering. No intersection is used and the influence of the reduction operator limiting to a tunable maximum the size of the matrices involved in the zonotopic set computations is fully taken into account in the LMI-based robust stability analysis. A numerical example illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed ZKF.},

abstract = {We consider a family of divergence-based minimax approaches to perform robust filtering. The mismodeling budget, or tolerance, is specified at each time increment of the model. More precisely, all possible model increments belong to a ball which is formed by placing a bound on the Tau-divergence family between the actual and the nominal model increment. Then, the robust filter is obtained by minimizing the mean square error according to the least favorable model in that ball. It turns out that the solution is a family of Kalman like filters. Their gain matrix is updated according to a risk sensitive like iteration where the risk sensitivity parameter is now time varying. As a consequence, we also extend the risk sensitive filter to a family of risk sensitive like filters according to the Tau-divergence family.},

abstract = {This paper is concerned with the resilient and secure remote monitoring of a cyber-physical system of a discrete time-varying state-space form against attacks. The specific statistical characteristic, magnitude, occurring place and time of the attack signals are not required during the monitor design and attack detection procedures. First, an optimal ellipsoidal state prediction and estimation method is delicately developed in such a way that the recursively computed prediction ellipsoid and estimate ellipsoid can both guarantee the containment of the true system state at each time step regardless of the unknown but bounded input signal. It is expected that the two ellipsoids can resist certain attacks as the calculated state prediction and state estimate are sets in state-space rather than single pointwise vectors, thus potentially enhancing the resilience of the remote monitoring system. Second, a set-based evaluation mechanism in combination with a remedy measure are proposed to provide timely detection of certain attacks. Furthermore, a numerically efficient algorithm is established to achieve resilience and attack detection of the remote monitoring system. Finally, it is shown through several case studies on a water supply distribution system that the proposed methods can provide quantitative analysis and evaluation of the potential consequences of various attacks on the remote monitoring system.},
