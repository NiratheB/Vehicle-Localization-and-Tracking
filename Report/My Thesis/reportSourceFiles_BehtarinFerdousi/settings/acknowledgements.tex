I want to thank Jagat Rath to help me from ground up for this thesis. His support and motivation have given me the confidence to work on this topic. Regardless of my countless silly questions, he was always patient and calm in discussions. I am grateful for his time and availability to me.

My deepest gratitude goes to Professor Matthias Althoff for his guidance and valuable advice. Despite his tremendously busy schedule, he has always given me detailed feedback and advice on my writings whenever I needed them. His detailed comments and suggestions have taught me to vastly improve my writing skills. 

My heartfelt gratitude goes to my husband who calmed me when I panicked, my parents who constantly encouraged me and believed in me, my sister for sharing laughter every now and then, and my in-laws for always supporting and standing by me. I feel blessed to have such a wonderful company around me and I thank God with all of my heart for the strength and opportunity to study here in TUM.
